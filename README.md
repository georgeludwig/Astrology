# Astrology
A fun project that mixes Chinese and Western astrology to create a composite compatibility score.

It's predictive, in the sense that it will tell you the sign of thje person you are looking for, 
as well as their age.

Because of the age component, you need to run the program regularly to get an up-to-date list.

The class to run is under the test directory, named CompositeTest.

Simply edit it to reflect your birthjday, and run the test.

There is a dependency on one of my personal jar files, which is included under the libvs directory.
Add it to your maven repo however you want to.

The program output will look something like this:

pisces and pisces with tiger and horse has a compatibility of 63
and are of the following ages 1,13,25,37,49,61,73,85
...
pisces and sagittarius with tiger and monkey has a compatibility of 2
and are of the following ages 10,22,34,46,58,70,82
